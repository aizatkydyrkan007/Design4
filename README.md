# 🏙️ Smart City Task Scheduling

This project implements **task scheduling algorithms** for Smart City / Smart Campus environments.  
It uses classical **graph algorithms** to analyze dependencies, define execution order, and optimize total task duration.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Detect cycles in task dependencies  
- Convert cyclic graphs into DAGs using SCC compression  
- Determine valid task execution order via Topological Sorting  
- Compute minimum and maximum completion times for all tasks  
- Identify the critical path and bottleneck tasks

📊 Analysis
SCC detection runs efficiently even on large graphs.

Graph density and number of cycles influence runtime performance.

Shortest Path computation is fast since DAGs contain no cycles.

Sparse graphs are easier to sort topologically, while dense graphs require more memory.

🧭 Conclusions
Use SCC to detect and compress cyclic dependencies.

Apply Topological Sort to define valid task execution order.

Use Shortest Path to compute minimal completion times.

Use Longest Path to identify critical paths and total project duration.

These algorithms form the foundation for task planning, maintenance scheduling, and workflow optimization in Smart City systems.
